# Lectures and speeches Dr. Dipak has given
- Delivered more than 30 lectures on Science for society.
- Delivered more than 50 motivational lectures for rural students.
- Counseling farmer to tackle with current farm related diseases like Telya (oily layers) on 
pomegranate. There is no farmer suicide in entire village from many years (since my birth) even though most of the village migrate for 6-8 months. How one can manage home economy? 
- Promoting eco-friendly village model on water table index and conservation of environment.
- Working as a counselor to village students to choose their career path after 10th and 12theducation.
- Several cases successfully explored where money is not the problem for education (even if you can’t afford the education). You need to give the confidence and moral boost. 
- Started small NGO in my village to tackle the rural school dropout.
- Created substantial PhD strength to tackle India’s problem and discussing several pathways to upbring the society using various technological innovation.
